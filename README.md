# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Codes for all Machine Learning Algorithms

# How To Proceed?
- Create a folder for the algorithm (if it does not exist already),for example for Multiple Linear Regression Code create a folder named Regression
- Create a subfolder with the name of the algorithm ( In this case Multiple Linear Regression)
- Add the code into the respective folder.
- Add the dataset which is being used.
- Add a md file with the same name which contains the steps to run your code .
